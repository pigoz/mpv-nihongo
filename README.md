## NOTE

I moved my efforts to [lat](https://github.com/pigoz/lat), this project is unmaintened

# mpv-nihongo

To use git-clone this repo and run `yarn install && yarn build` to compile.

You need to use mpv with my [personal patches](https://github.com/pigoz/mpv/commits/personal-fork) to get the current subtitle's timestamps for sub2srs.ts to work. I will upstream them when I'm less lazy.

## Included scripts

### jplookup.ts

analyzes the current subtitle with mecab, searches lemmas containing Kanji's
in a dictionary, and displays them on the top left corner of the video

### sub2srs.ts

exports the current subtitle to an Anki card complete with image and audio,
dictionary lookups, and kanji readings from mecab with the press of a button
